# digimon-app
I developed a Pokémon-Digimon hybrid app that allows users to explore different Digimon and their evolution levels, leveraging data from a Pokémon API. The app provides an interactive experience where users can browse various Digimon, view their progression through different stages, and access key details about each character. To enhance engagement, I implemented a dynamic interface that presents evolution pathways in an intuitive way. This project challenged me to work with API integration, data parsing, and UI design to create a smooth and visually appealing user experience.
